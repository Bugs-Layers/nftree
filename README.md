### üåç Web App: Incentivizing a Greener Future

*Our platform empowers users to contribute to a sustainable world.*

## How It Works:
1. **Plant a Tree:** 
   - Users can plant a tree in the real world.
   
2. **Upload a Picture:**
   - Capture and upload a picture of the planted tree to our web app.

3. **Tokenize as a Real World Asset (RWA):**
   - The tree is **tokenized** on the blockchain as an *RWA*.

4. **Receive Carbon Credits:**
   - Users receive **Carbon Credits** for their contribution.

## Benefits:
- **Environmental Impact:**
  - Many companies are on a mission to **reduce their carbon footprint** or achieve *carbon neutrality*.

- **Financial Incentives:**
  - Users can **sell** their Carbon Credits on **Web3 marketplaces**.

- **Motivation to Plant More Trees:**
  - This initiative provides both *motivation* and **incentives** for users to plant more trees.

Join us in creating a greener future and be part of a global movement towards sustainability!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
